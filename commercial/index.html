        <p>When new aircraft parts are not readily available from inventory, you can utilize Our Aircraft Spares & Alternates Procurement (ASAP) services to determine if a hard to find aircraft or engine part, component or accessory, or an suitable and approved substitute, whether new, new surplus, overhauled, or serviceable, is available elsewhere in the market. Through this service, IASA Group's highly trained purchasing staff coordinate with Staff FAA-DARs and other airworthiness staff to make a determination if a suitable unit exists for customers with airplane-on-ground requirements (AOG requirements) or other critical needs to obtain their required aircraft parts quickly and ensure cost savings while complying with the highest standards of Quality Assurance.</p>
